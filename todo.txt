- vim extended bad-whitespace plugin
-- filetypes excluded from bad whitespace: help, diff
- vimrc: F8 should also do the mouse, and enter/exit insert mode
- something in the prompt to remind you you're inside screen
- make scrolling work in screen
- diff parameters (e.g. -U) for git-diff-*
- findgrep should support spaces
