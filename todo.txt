- required packages
- vim extended bad-whitespace plugin
-- filetypes excluded from bad whitespace: help, diff
- vimrc: F8 should also do the mouse, and enter/exit insert mode
- something in the prompt to remind you you're inside screen
- make scrolling work in screen
- help for git-diff-*
- diff parameters (e.g. -U) for git-diff-*
- see if __get_working_copy() and friends can use some simplifications
- try to get title() to get the current title and assign conditionally (based on a switch)
	- alias 'build' and 'kbuild' to "title build; build"
	- have 'vm' change the title
