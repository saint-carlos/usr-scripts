- required packages
- better config system (kconfig? something simpler?)
- feature to update from current installation (e.g. edit `which findgrep` and port the changes to src/bin/findgrep)
-- call it 'make import'
- colordiffrc
- use 'tput setaf' instead of hard coded color sequences which don't work in linux-console. tput should be queried once when bashrc is read, not every time we present the prompt.
- see if we can move setting terminal title from the prompt itself to the prompt function
-- use tput tsl, tput fsl
- vim extended bad-whitespace plugin
-- filetypes excluded from bad whitespace: help, diff
