- required packages
- more usable userrc, at least rename to bashrc.user
- better config system (kconfig? something simpler?)
- feature to update from current installation (e.g. edit `which findgrep` and port the changes to src/bin/findgrep)
- make help
- option to configure whether or not PS1 displays the user name
- option to configure whether or not PS1 displays the whole directory
- colordiffrc
- use 'tput setaf' instead of hard coded color sequences which don't work in linux-console. tput should be queried once when bashrc is read, not every time we present the prompt.
- see if we can move setting terminal title from the prompt itself to the prompt function
-- use tput tsl, tput fsl
- mfilter should use grep -e
- vim extended bad-whitespace plugin
-- filetypes excluded from bad whitespace: help, diff
